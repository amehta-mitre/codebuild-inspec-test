  title "PostgreSQL must enforce discretionary access control policies, as
  defined by the data owner, over defined subjects and objects."
  desc  "Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is based on the notion that
  individual users are \"owners\" of objects and therefore have discretion over
  who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or
  write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object
  or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who
  will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes
  user-controlled table permissions.
  When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not
  constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for
  which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been
  granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the
  subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or
  objects.
  A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control
  policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this
  requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints
  preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at
  a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass
  the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level.
  The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information
  is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means
  may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect. While the older,
  more traditional definitions of discretionary access control require i
  dentity-based access control, that limitation is not required for this use of
  discretionary access control."
